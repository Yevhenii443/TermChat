<h1>TermChat</h1>

## The main idea

Understand how the TCP / IP and UDP protocols work. How to work with multithreading and understand asynchronous programming.

We managed to make a chat in almost 3 weeks. In order to run it, you will need to download a couple of Python modules: \
<code>pip install pyfiglet</code> \
<code>pip install sqlite3</code>

And this is how it looks:
